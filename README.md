# MediaMonks.ReactNative
This is MediaMonks React Native challenge.

What is missing:

Redux-persistance: I implemented the library as stated by website: "https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist", but app throws an error when trying to create sync storage. Did some research on this, but couldn't come up with a workaround or solution. Maybe with some more time.

Photo Detail: I wanted to use a dialog-like pop up when clicking a photo, to show it's detail, but couldn't make the dialog to work.

iOS testing: I don't own a Macbook or Mac computer, so I couldn't test wether the app could run on iOS.

Aesthetic detailing: I didn't had time to make the app better looking (a splashScreen, a custom Icon, etc) since I prioritized making the app fully functional before.
